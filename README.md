# End-to-end-Bengali-handwritten-text-to-speech-synthesis-pipeline
The  primary  objective  of  this  project,  several  method  has  been  implemented  to  recognize Handwritten Bengali Character by a convolutional neural network (CNN).
Individual characters are extracted from the handwritten Bengali sentence is boundary tracing along with a segmentation algorithm. Character is identified to its shapes and several features that help to classification by ResNet34 pre-trained model. This residual network is a deeper neural network that is achieved 3.57% error on the ImageNet data set.  
The system was trained by more than 200000 Bengali handwritten images.  The classifier returns some parametersto create a text and this text is converted into speech using TTS. Along with deep learn-ing, text to speech synthesizing technology also substantially improved during these times. This approach helps to construct an end-to-end Bengali handwritten text-to-speech synthesissystem.
